# Hi, I'm Nouman

I'm a self-taught web developer currently learning and building projects to improve my frontend development skills.

### Projects I've completed:

- **My First Portfolio** â€“ A simple personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS.  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/coding-nouman/my-first-portfolio)

- **Nouman Blog** â€“ A basic blog layout created with semantic HTML and styled with CSS.  
  [Coming Soon](https://github.com/coding-nouman/Nouman-Blog)

I'm currently focused on improving my CSS by learning layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, and practicing responsive design.

I use Git and GitHub to manage my code and track my learning progress.
